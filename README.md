# 🦁 Hi, I'm Jefferson Smith Cañas Espinosa

💻 Frontend Software Developer | 🎓 Software Development Technician  
🌍 Bilingual: English 🇺🇸 | Spanish 🇨🇴

I'm a frontend developer with hands-on experience building scalable, responsive interfaces using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Liquid (Shopify)**. I follow clean code principles and apply best practices to deliver maintainable and user-friendly web solutions.

I’ve worked on real-world projects in collaboration with senior developers and clients, contributing to production-level codebases in private repositories. My work includes interactive components, Shopify theme customization, and performance-focused UI development.

Additionally, I have experience using **Shopify**, **Peoplevine**, **Squarespace**, and **Webflow** to build and manage dynamic websites for clients.

🍜 I’m also into anime, ramen, and lifting weights—my way to stay creative, focused, and motivated.
